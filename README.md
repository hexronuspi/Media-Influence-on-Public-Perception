## Version 1: Twitter Sentiment Analysis with snscrape
#### Overview
This repository offers a machine learning model that gathers tweets for sentiment analysis using snscrape, a Python package for scraping data from Twitter. The methodology attempts to categorise tweet sentiment as good, negative, or neutral, so offering insights into public thoughts and attitudes.

#### Features
- **Data Scraping**: The model leverages snscrape to scrape tweets based on user-defined search queries, hashtags, or user profiles. The scraped data includes the tweet text, user information, timestamp, and other relevant metadata.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model analyzes the scraped tweets and assigns sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) to each tweet. This allows for quantifying the overall sentiment of a specific topic or assessing the sentiment of individual tweets.
