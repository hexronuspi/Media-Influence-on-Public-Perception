# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with snscrape

## Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning model that performs sentiment analysis on tweets gathered from Twitter using the snscrape Python library. The primary objective of this model is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, enabling the extraction of valuable insights into public opinions and attitudes.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: The model leverages snscrape to scrape tweets based on user-defined search queries, hashtags, or user profiles. The scraped data includes the tweet text, user information, timestamp, and other relevant metadata.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model analyzes the scraped tweets and assigns sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) to each tweet. This allows for quantifying the overall sentiment of a specific topic or assessing the sentiment of individual tweets.
